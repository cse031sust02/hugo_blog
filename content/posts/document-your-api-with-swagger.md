## What is Swagger?

Swagger is a very popular framework for describing RESTful APIs using a common language that everyone can understand. It is actually a set of open-source tools for designing, building, documenting and consuming REST APIs.

#### Swagger Specification?

The Swagger Specification (currently known as the OpenAPI specification) is a powerful definition format to describe RESTful APIs. The specification creates a RESTful interface for easily developing and consuming an API by effectively mapping all the resources and operations associated with it. Itâ€™s easy-to-learn, language agnostic, and both human and machine readable.

## Swager Tools

As stated earlier, Swagger is actually a set of open-source tools :

- **[Swagger Editor](https://editor.swagger.io)** : We can design new APIs (or edit existing ones) using Swagger Editor. It visually renders our OAS/Swagger definition with concise, real time feedback and error handling.
- **[Swagger Codegen](https://swagger.io/swagger-codegen/)** : It is a tool for turning OAS/Swagger definition into code. Codegen can build and enable consumption of our Swagger defined APIs in every popular language.
- **[Swagger UI](https://swagger.io/swagger-ui/)** : Swagger UI takes OAS/Swagger definition, presents them visually and allows us to execute operations.
- **[Swagger Inspector](https://swagger.io/swagger-inspector/)** : It is a API inspection tool (Like Postman) to work with REST, GraphQL and SOAP based web services.
